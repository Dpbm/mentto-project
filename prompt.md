Create a web application which its goal is to manage OKRs.

To do that, you need to do the following:

1. Create a page to login with email and password.
2. Create a page to register a new user.
3. Create a page for password reset.
4. create a home page listing user's OKRs.
5. create a page to insert new OKRs. You must also add a droparea in which a user can
drop a .xlsx file and the software must extract the OKRs from there.
6. Each OKR must have a page to be edited and deleted. So each OKR on the home must be clickable
and redirect the user to that specific OKR page.

make sure that:
- the layour is clean
- best practices are used for development
- supabase is used for managing user's data
- an email is sent everytime an OKR is modified
